        Justin is a really friendly and patient driving instructor. I had failed
        my driving test 3 times before I had met him and he made me feel really
        calm and confident in what I was doing. I passed my test because of
        him.Â

        I just want to say a huge thank you to Justin for getting me ready to
        sit and pass my driving test. He has a very friendly and patient manner
        which immediately put me at ease during my lessons. He explained
        everything really well to me and was always more than happy to answer
        any questions I had. He built up my confidence very quickly and because
        of that I enjoyed learning to drive. If anyone is thinking of learning
        to drive than I would highly recommend Justin.

        Thanks for all your help getting me through the test! You were very
        helpful and always willing to talk me through any problems I had as well
        as explaining new manoeuvres thoroughly and tailoring the lessons to my
        specific needs. If I had any weak points in my driving they were quickly
        rectified. All in all a wonderful way to learn!

        Thank you so so much Justin for helping me get this driving test. Not
        only are you a good driving instructor, your patience and encouraging
        mannerism were key to helping prepare me for my test. You spot mistakes
        well and correct them, whilst still being encouraging. A desired trait
        in an instructor! I wish you the very best with future students and will
        definitely recommend you to all our friends and family :)
