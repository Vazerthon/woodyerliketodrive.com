        I am a relaxed, friendly instructor who, because every person is
        individual, will adapt teaching methods to match your needs. I operate
        completely independently which means there are no restraints in how you
        want to learn; if you’re looking for just weekly lessons then that’s no
        problem. If you have a specific target in mind and need a more intensive
        course to attain the target, then we can work together to reach your
        goals. Have a look at my <a href="prices.html">prices page</a> to see
        what would be best for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work I am an active person who enjoys various activites
        ranging from golf, football and skiing. I have lived in Penicuik for my
        whole life and know all the surrounding areas well including, Peebles,
        West Linton, Loanhead, Dalkeith and Muselburgh. I cover all areas of
        Midlothian.
        <br />
        As Penicuik is situated perfectly in between the three local test areas
        of Peebles, Musselburgh and Currie, I am familiar with all the areas and
        roads that get used for your test when it comes around.
