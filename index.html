      <p>
        WoodyerLiketoDrive is a new independent instructor with a high pass rate
        in the Midlothian and north Borders area. Covering Penicuik, Peebles,
        West Linton, Loanhead, Dalkeith, Musselburgh and all other Midlothian
        towns and villages. I am a fully qualified government Approved Driving
        Instructor which means I am governed by the DSA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being happy and comfortable in your lessons is a key factor, this is why
        I always offer your first lesson
        <a href="prices.html">half price</a> with no strings attached.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can offer weekly, semi intensive or intensive courses to suit your
        lesson requirements. If you donâ€™t see a
        <a href="prices.html">price</a> or course that suits you, just contact me
        and we can discuss any requirements you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can assist with Theory Test revision to help along your way. Along
        with regular lessons I also offer refresher lessons, if you have been
        out of the car for a while and are looking for some confidence to get
        back out on the road again. I am pass plus registered to help gain
        further experience after you have passed with the additional bonus of
        potentially up to 10% reduction in your insurance costs.
